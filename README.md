# Andy McG's Website

Hello and welcome to the Epsilon version of my website!

This version is an experiment with Gatsby.js, and so far, I'm having a blast!

I hope to have this version finished before long (after all, my website is just a splash page currently...), so check back here if you'd like to keep up with the changes.

Thanks and see you soon!
